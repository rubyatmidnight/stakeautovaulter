New stealth mode:   http://puu.sh/KGluu.png

Click the little circle in the upper right corner of the floaty window 

It will minimize to the bottom right of the page 


How to use: http://puu.sh/KGlz7.png

Save %: in decimal, the % of how much you want the profit difference to send to vault. 0.14 = 14% of the profit. 

Big win threshold: If a win increases your balance by this much as a multiple (if balance was 10 units, and you hit for 50+ units it will hit )


Issues:

If you have games open in multiple tabs, and also start this in multiple tabs, it will double/triple deposit.
